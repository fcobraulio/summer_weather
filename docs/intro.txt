In the first two years since the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the world has recorded a total of about 290 million cases and 4.5 million deaths. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic, followed by severe educational, economic and social impacts on a global scale. Since COVID-19 is a highly transmissible respiratory disease, the main preventive measures are vaccination and nonpharmacological interventions (NPIs), such as the use of masks and social distancing. However, these interventions need to be widely accepted by the population to be effective, and the media framing of health messages have importance in shaping community risk perceptions of emerging public health issues.
